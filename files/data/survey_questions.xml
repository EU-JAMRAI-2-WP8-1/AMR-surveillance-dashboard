&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each partner country in JAMRAI-2 WP8.1 should appoint a single coordinator to complete the questionnaire. The coordinator is responsible for contacting relevant national stakeholders in the country to gather the necessary input. Core competencies needed to answer the questionnaire include: clinical microbiology, epidemiology, whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics, and an understanding of the structure of national surveillance system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the questions keeping in mind that they refer to: &lt;br /&gt;- National guidance and surveillance system(s) for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the human sector, &lt;br /&gt;- Pathogens of interest, see section below for the list of included pathogens,&lt;br /&gt;- Isolates from clinical infections (unless stated otherwise).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Please select the option that best describes the situation in your country even if it is not an exact match. If the question is impossible to answer from your perspective, please contact Amy or Sofia (emails below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The questionnaire includes around 45 questions. Some questions include a follow up question that are dependent on the answer provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No questions require that you submit actual data or numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time it will take to answer the questions will likely vary between countries (as a minimum 2h are likely needed). Please look through all questions to get a better understanding of how much time is required. Some factors that will influence the time include how many persons the national coordinator needs to contact and the general organization of the national surveillance system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The survey can be started and finished at a later stage but it must be saved before leaving the webpage. To do this, click “Save as draft” which is located on the right-hand side of the webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the survey is finished you must click “Submit” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deadline for completing the survey is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Friday February 28, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            <Text id="3edb8d11-569e-4400-865c-24f6028ab3f5" type="Text">&lt;span style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background, aim, and structure of questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMRAI-2 is an EU-funded One Health Joint Action project focused on different aspects on &lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;the containment of&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#xa0;AMR. The stated outcome of the human AMR surveillance package (Task 8.1) is “Strengthening national surveillance systems in the human sector”. As a part of this effort, we have designed this questi&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;onnaire to collect i&lt;/span&gt;nformation needed to build an inventory of national surveillance systems for AMR in the human sector within European countries.&amp;#xa0;The inventory adds to and complements ongoing work at the ECDC, WHO and the European Reference Laboratory for AMR. The focus of the inventory is not on AMR data but to collate information of the underlying surveillance systems producing and collecting the data in each country, and how the data is presented and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall aim of the inventory is to serve as a tool to strengthen surveillance of AMR in the human sector in Europe by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a joint public dashboard where the collected information on how European countries structure their national surveillance of AMR is displayed. The main focus is on phenotypic and genotypic surveillance. The dashboard should serve as inspiration, facilitate collaboration and enable follow up of changes made to countries surveillance systems over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a later stage, the information gathered in the inventory together with other sources of information will be used to build an interactive roadmap where specific actions to improve surveillance will be displayed. The roadmap will also include suggestions on capacity-strengthening initiatives that would be needed to achieve the suggested enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This questionnaire is designed to capture the content that is going to be displayed in the dashboard. It includes different perspectives of AMR surveillance such as&amp;#xa0; guidance, structure, content and the use of data from a national perspective (Figure 1). The majority of the questions concern the national AMR surveillance system(s). Some questions concern the presence of national guidance aimed for healthcare facilities and clinical microbiological laboratories at a regional level that collect and provide AMR data. The rationale for including this is that the initial data collection and analysis influence the comparability and representation of the data submitted to the national surveillance system. Another important aspect we want to capture is how AMR data is used. A potential area with high impact for both patient treatment and antibiotic use is the development of treatment guidelines for common infections based on available quality assured Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication and processing of data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;All non-personal data collected in this inventory will be made publicly available during the project. Data collected that are considered personal are; full name, email, institution and type of institution. The responses to the survey will be compiled, analyzed and displayed by country in a public dashboard. Both the inventory and the dashboard are being developed during the JAMRAI-2 project as a proof of concept. The long-term goal is to create a sustainable working methodology that can live on and be continuously updated after the JAMRAI-2 collaboration has ended. &lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;You will find more information about personal data processing and GDPR in the privacy statement in the Background documents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structure of the questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire is designed to be answered from a national perspective and is structured into three sections, as illustrated in Figure 1. The following expertise will be useful when answering the different parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Section 1:&lt;/strong&gt; A microbiologist at the national reference laboratory or equivalent national expert laboratory with knowledge about healthcare structures relating to AMR, and the national process(es) to generate national guidance. The questions are designed to be answered from a national perspective and there should be no need to contact individual laboratories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 2:&lt;/strong&gt; A microbiologist and/or bioinformatician working at the national reference laboratory or an equivalent national expert laboratory with the responsibility to perform/manage WGS for AMR nationally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 3:&lt;/strong&gt; A microbiologist/epidemiologist at the national level with knowledge about the set-up and content of the national AMR surveillance system(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt; The different sections and their content included in the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Text id="b3543143-906c-4bf2-afee-cee0d24c8b76" type="Text">&lt;strong&gt;Included pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The included pathogens are in line with the list under surveillance by ECDC (EARS-Net) and the WHO pathogen priority list for AMR bacteria. The main focus is on clinical isolates from human infections, unless otherwise specified. Please answer the questions from this perspective. &lt;br /&gt; The included pathogens can cause severe infections in humans, most of them healthcare-associated infections and outbreaks. Healthcare-associated infections with the included AMR pathogens are currently the major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans in Europe. Several of the included pathogens are also important from a One Health perspective considering that they can infect and form reservoirs in both animals and the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Included pathogens and their resistance (R) phenotypes used throughout the questionnaire:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;: Third-Generation Cephalosporin resistance (3GC-R), carbapenem resistance (carbapenem-R) and colistin resistance (colistin-R).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;: Third-Generation Cephalosporin resistance (3GC-R), carbapenem resistance (carbapenem-R) and colistin resistance (colistin-R).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;: carbapenem resistance (carbapenem-R).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;: carbapenem resistance (carbapenem-R).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;: methicillin resistance (MRSA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/em&gt;: vancomycin resistance (VRE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;: penicillin resistance and macrolide resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt;: ampicillin resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excluded pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some pathogens, including fungi, parasites and viruses, fall outside of the scope of this questionnaire, although they may become relevant for future surveys. In addition to these pathogens, we have decided to exclude:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae:&lt;/em&gt; These bacteria do not fall within the defined categories listed above. In addition, many countries have separate surveillance systems, laboratories and networks specifically for these bacteria. This makes it logistically difficult to combine into a single questionnaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food and waterborne bacterial pathogens: Bacterial pathogens such as &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; are not generally healthcare-associated. In addition, many countries have separate surveillance systems and approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;AMR:&lt;/strong&gt; Antimicrobial Resistance&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AST:&lt;/strong&gt; Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3GC:&lt;/strong&gt; Third-Generation Cephalosporin&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CML:&lt;/strong&gt; Clinical Microbiological Laboratory&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CSF:&lt;/strong&gt; Cerebral Spinal Fluid&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Community-associated infection&lt;/strong&gt;: Referring to infections that are contracted in a community setting, i.e. outside of a healthcare facility.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ECDC:&lt;/strong&gt; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Empiric treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The initiation of antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen and resistance identification. This would be based on available data and clinical experience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extended AST:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to any additional AST performed on an isolate that has undergone a first routine AST. Often this is performed on specific resistant phenotypes where additional treatment options might be needed. Can also be performed for surveillance purposes. Does not refer to repetition of AST at national reference laboratory or confirmation of resistance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Healthcare-associated infection:&lt;/strong&gt; As defined by WHO, an infection occurring in a patient while in the care of a hospital or other healthcare facility, which was not present or incubating at the time of admission. Healthcare-associated infections can also appear after discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate data:&lt;/strong&gt; used when referring to microbiological data.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;LTCF-associated infection:&lt;/strong&gt; An infection occurring in a patient who is a resident at a long-term care facility.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;National Guidance:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommendation from a governmental agency, a national/sub-national working group, a recognized independent organization or equivalent group/organization. It does not need to be legally binding but issued from a high trust group/organization/society whose authority is nationally recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;National AMR surveillance system(s):&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the combined AMR data that is available at the national level. This information can be collected in one or several different systems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NRL:&lt;/strong&gt; National Reference Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient/case data:&lt;/strong&gt; used when referring to data that originates from the patient, such as age and sex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;R and/or P:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to if a bacteria has a phenotypic resistance (R) to antibiotics regardless of the mechanism of resistance and/or genetically confirmed producer (P) of a specific enzyme that is able to break down the antibiotic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Real-time system/data:&lt;/strong&gt; A system that transfers data automatically/semi-automatically with minimal delay (generally no more than one week). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Routine AST:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to the first AST performed when a bacterial infection has been identified in a patient sample&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;UTI:&lt;/strong&gt; urinary tract infection&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;WGS:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole Genome Sequencing&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;WHO:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Organization</Text>
