<h2>About the dashboard</h2>

<br>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>This dashboard has been developed within the EU funded Joint Action project called <a href="https://eu-jamrai.eu/surveillance/" target="_blank">EU-JAMRAI 2</a> (2024-2027).</p>

<p>Our goal is to strengthen national AMR surveillance systems in the human sector across participating countries and the European region. This is an active development project which means that alterations will be made continuously. The dashboard is an important tool in our work since the visualization of surveillance information enables joint analysis and discussions.</p>

<p>If you have any input please feel free to reach out, see contact information at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3>What is included in the dashboard?</h3>

<p>The dashboard displays the current national microbiological AMR surveillance in the EU-JAMRAI 2 partner countries. The inventory adds to and complements ongoing work at ECDC, WHO and the European Reference Laboratory for AMR. The focus of the inventory is not on AMR data but to collate information of the underlying surveillance structure and systems producing and collecting the data in each country, and how the data is presented and used.</p>

<br>
<h3>How was the information collected?</h3>

<p>The information presented in this dashboard was collected in winter/spring 2025 via a questionnaire developed within the project. You find the questionnaire <a href="https://eu-jamrai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EU_JAMRAI_WP8_inventory_AMRsurveillance_humans.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>One coordinator per country was responsible for collecting the answers, filling them in and submitting the questionnaire through the questionnaire tool EUSurvey.</p>

<br>
<h3>Technical specifications</h3>

<p>The dashboard was developed using R Shiny. Technical specifications can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/EU-JAMRAI-2-WP8-1/AMR-surveillance-dashboard" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<h3>Calculation of scores</h3>

<p>To enable the visualisation of different answeres per country there is a scoring system applied.</p>

<p>Each question has a coefficient (weight) associated to it, which alters how the question should be counted to the overall score. In the same way each possible answer to each question has a value (0-1) associated to it. Multiplying the coefficient (question) with the value (answer) for each question/answer provides a score. A final score between 0 to 1 is obtained by summing all scores, and normalizing using the maximum score. The score is recalculated based on the filters used.</p>
